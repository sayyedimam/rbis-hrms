- **CEO**: High-level overview with access to Records and Organization-wide statistics.
- **Employee**: Personal dashboard view with self-service leave management and attendance history.

### 🚀 Core Modules

#### 1. 🖥️ Interactive Dashboard

- **Real-Time Insight**: Instant visualization of Present, Absent, and On-Leave statistics.
- **Context-Aware Drilling**: Clickable cards revealing detailed tables for specific statuses.

#### 2. 📈 Advanced Analytics
